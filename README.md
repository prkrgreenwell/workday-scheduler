# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Here is a daily calendar that I used to practice JQuery, Bootstrap, Local Storage (that I struggled with last week), as well as learning how to use Day.js. It shows the date and dynamically changes the hour color with the time.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Professionals can use this to save appointments throughout the day, and it will save on a local device when the window is refreshed.

## Credits
